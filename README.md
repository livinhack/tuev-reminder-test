# TÜV Reminder r033

**Reminder r033** polishes the Reminder-owned Sidebar vehicle list toward a Switch-Manager-style full-width manager view. The page remains read-only and Reminder-only; Card code and Card actions are not imported or duplicated. The r028 Manager API foundation, r029 service-await fix, r030 sensor/readmodel consistency and r031/r032 Sidebar work remain preserved.

Compatible stack:

```text
Card b355+ / b356 RC + Reminder r033
```

## What the integration does

TÜV Reminder stores one vehicle per Home Assistant config entry/device and exposes one TÜV/HU sensor per vehicle.

Each vehicle can store:

- vehicle name
- license plate text with preserved whitespace
- license plate type: standard, seasonal, change plate, green, green + seasonal
- license plate format: single-line, two-line, small two-line, motorcycle
- H/E suffix flags for non-green plates
- season months where applicable
- HU month/year and inspection interval
- reminder offset in days

## Installation / update

Install the custom integration as `custom_components/tuev_reminder/` in Home Assistant, then restart Home Assistant and add vehicles through the integration UI.

When updating from an older test ZIP, replace the complete `custom_components/tuev_reminder/` folder with the new one from this package and restart Home Assistant.

The Card is a separate project. Use **Card b355 or newer** for the new Reminder v3 attributes.

## Calendar

The integration provides one shared virtual calendar:

```text
calendar.tuev_reminder
```

The calendar is detached from individual vehicle devices and belongs to the TÜV Reminder integration/manager context. It does **not** write events to `local_calendar`, Google Calendar or any external calendar. Events are generated dynamically from the configured vehicles.

For every vehicle the calendar always shows:

- `TÜV/HU Erinnerung`
- `TÜV/HU fällig`

The configurable timing option is:

```text
reminder_offset_days
```

Old stored `calendar_event_mode` values are ignored for compatibility; the runtime behaves as always reminder + due.

## Card compatibility

Card b355 reads the new Reminder attributes for green plates, seasonal plates, change plates, H/E suffix flags and plate format.

Important attributes exposed by each vehicle sensor include:

```text
plate
plate_base
plate_display
plate_kind
plate_format
plate_color_mode
plate_suffix
plate_suffix_h
plate_suffix_e
seasonal
season_start_month
season_end_month
change_plate_enabled
change_plate_common_text
change_plate_vehicle_digit
change_plate_vehicle_text
reminder_offset_days
```

Whitespace in `plate` is preserved because the Card/renderer needs the block structure.

## Services

### `tuev_reminder.confirm_passed`

Updates the next HU date after a passed inspection.

```yaml
service: tuev_reminder.confirm_passed
data:
  entity_id: sensor.example_tuv
```

Optional inspection date:

```yaml
service: tuev_reminder.confirm_passed
data:
  entity_id: sensor.example_tuv
  passed_date: "2027-04-23"
```

### `tuev_reminder.set_due_date`

Directly sets HU month/year.

```yaml
service: tuev_reminder.set_due_date
data:
  entity_id: sensor.example_tuv
  month: 7
  year: 2027
```

## Release asset builder

The current development ZIP keeps the test-series version format:

```text
0.1.0-r033
```

r028 added `scripts/build_public_release_zip.py`; r029 keeps it for creating a public `v0.1.0` release-candidate ZIP from the internal r-series checkout. The development ZIP keeps `0.1.0-r029`; the generated public ZIP patches the manifest to `0.1.0`. See `docs/REMINDER_R028_PUBLIC_RELEASE_ASSET_BUILDER.md`.

## Local validation

From the repository root, run:

```bash
python scripts/run_all_checks.py
```

The runner performs Python syntax checks, JSON validation and all `check_r*.py` checks, then removes generated cache artifacts.

## Troubleshooting

### Old red calendar entries are still visible

Those are likely from an older local calendar such as `TÜV`. The Reminder integration does not write to `local_calendar`; it only exposes `calendar.tuev_reminder`.

### Card does not show green/season/change plates

Use Card b355 or newer. Older Card versions only read the legacy plate attributes.

### Area-code autocomplete

There is no browser-style live autocomplete in the normal HA Config Flow. The idea is reserved for a future Sidebar/Manager UI. No Sidebar/Manager UI yet.

## Historical compatibility baseline

Reminder r009 remains the tested Card-bridge runtime baseline for Card b355. Leerzeichen im Kennzeichen bleiben erhalten.
The stable Reminder r009 runtime line remains preserved for Card b355 compatibility.

Historical runtime baseline: TÜV Reminder r020 / Reminder r020 is the Calendar Always Due stabilization line preserved by Reminder r028.

## r028 Manager API Foundation

r028 adds a read-only Manager API foundation for a later Sidebar/Manager UI.

New WebSocket commands:

- `tuev_reminder/manager/metadata`
- `tuev_reminder/manager/vehicles/list`
- `tuev_reminder/manager/vehicles/get`

The API returns normalized vehicle data for a future manager frontend. The existing Home Assistant Config-/Options-Flow remains the active UI.

No Sidebar frontend, no write API and no Area-Code autocomplete UI are included yet.

## r031 Sidebar Panel Foundation

r031 adds a Reminder-only Home Assistant Sidebar panel foundation. It registers a `TÜV Reminder` panel at `/tuev-reminder`, serves `frontend/tuev-reminder-panel.js` from the integration, and uses the existing read-only Manager WebSocket API to show a first vehicle overview shell.

The Sidebar panel intentionally does not contain Card code, plate renderer code or duplicated Card actions. Its target is a later Switch-Manager-style entity creation and management page for Reminder entities.

## r030 Sensor Boolean/Kind Consistency

r030 aligns the sensor runtime with the Manager read model for legacy or manually edited entries:

- invalid stored `plate_kind` values no longer pass through as-is,
- string values such as `"false"` are coerced consistently,
- green plate kinds force sensor-side green color mode,
- seasonal plate kinds force sensor-side seasonal attributes.

No Card bridge attributes are removed. Normal current entries should look unchanged.

## r029 Service Await Fix

r029 fixes the internal async handling of the service entry resolver used by:

- `tuev_reminder.confirm_passed`
- `tuev_reminder.set_due_date`

Both service handlers now await `_resolve_tuev_entry(...)` before reading config entry data/options and reloading the entry. Card attributes, calendar behavior and the read-only r028 Manager API remain unchanged.

## r032 Sidebar Vehicle List

r032 keeps the Sidebar panel Reminder-only and improves the first manager page from a shell into a read-only vehicle overview. The page now shows status metrics, a searchable/filterable/sortable vehicle table, HU date, reminder date, expired date, plate kind, plate format and sensor entity id.

It still intentionally contains no Card code, no plate renderer, no Dashboard configuration and no duplicated actions such as `confirm_passed` or `set_due_date`.

## r033 Switch-Manager-style Sidebar Polish

r033 keeps the Sidebar panel inside the Reminder integration and improves the read-only vehicle list toward the Switch Manager reference: compact top bar, toolbar search, dense table rows, row-end Kennzeichen preview and disabled row menu placeholder. The preview is a lightweight Reminder UI fallback only; the Card repository remains separate.
